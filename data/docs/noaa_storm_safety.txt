Storm events include severe thunderstorms, heavy rain, flash floods, and strong winds.
Frequent or intense storms can lead to localized flooding, soil erosion, and infrastructure damage.
NOAA recommends tracking storm frequency to assess long-term risk for communities and builders.
Areas with more than five significant storm events per year are considered high exposure zones.
Mitigation: Design drainage systems for heavy rainfall, use surge protectors, and reinforce roofs against high winds.
