Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) represents the maximum shaking intensity expected during an earthquake.
It is expressed as a fraction of gravity (g). Values above 0.3g are considered strong and can cause serious structural damage if buildings are not designed for seismic loads.
USGS seismic hazard maps estimate PGA with a 2% probability of exceedance in 50 years, roughly corresponding to major earthquakes.
High PGA areas in California coincide with active fault zones such as the San Andreas and Hayward Faults.
Mitigation: Use reinforced concrete or steel frames, secure heavy furniture, and include seismic anchoring for foundations.
