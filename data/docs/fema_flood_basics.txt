Floodplains are low-lying areas next to rivers, lakes, or coastlines that are naturally subject to flooding.
FEMA defines the 100-year floodplain as an area with a 1% annual chance of flooding. These are often called Zone A or AE.
Floods can occur from heavy rainfall, overflowing rivers, levee breaches, or blocked drainage systems.
Building in a flood zone requires elevated foundations, proper drainage, and flood-resistant materials.
Even areas outside the 100-year floodplain can still experience surface flooding during intense storms.
Mitigation: Elevate structures above base flood elevation, grade lots to direct runoff away from buildings, and consider flood insurance.
