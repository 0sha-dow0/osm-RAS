The California Fire Hazard Severity Zone (FHSZ) maps identify areas where wildfires are most likely to occur and where fire behavior can be most extreme.
Zones are categorized as Moderate, High, or Very High based on vegetation, slope, weather patterns, and fire history.
Very High zones have the greatest risk of fast-moving, intense fires that can ignite structures directly or via embers.
Construction in these zones should use non-combustible roofs, ember-resistant vents, and maintain defensible space of at least 100 feet.
Mitigation: Clear vegetation near homes, use fire-resistant materials, and establish emergency access routes.
